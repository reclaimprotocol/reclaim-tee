# TEE + MPC Protocol Implementation

This is a production-grade implementation of the TEE + MPC protocol for secure TLS communication with split AEAD processing. The system enables users to prove data from HTTPS websites while maintaining privacy through redaction capabilities and zero-knowledge proofs.

## Project Structure

The codebase is organized into multiple components for modularity and maintainability:

## Components

### Core Services

- **TEE_K** (tee_k/) - Key holder TEE service that manages TLS connections
  - Handles TLS handshake with target websites
  - Performs encryption operations with actual keys
  - Manages session state and WebSocket connections
  - Provides attestation capabilities
  - Runs on port 8080 by default

- **TEE_T** (tee_t/) - Tag computation TEE service for authentication
  - Computes and verifies authentication tags
  - Assists in split AEAD processing without key access
  - Handles transcript generation
  - Provides independent attestation
  - Runs on port 8081 by default

- **Client** (demo_standalone/) - Orchestrates the protocol
  - Establishes secure WebSocket connections with both TEEs
  - Manages request redaction and response verification
  - Initializes ZK circuits for OPRF proofs
  - Generates final proof transcripts

### Supporting Components

- **Proxy** (proxy/) - HTTP/HTTPS proxy service for protocol mediation
  - Routes requests between clients and TEE services
  - Provides KMS and CloudWatch proxy functionality
  - Separate Go module with independent deployment

- **Shared Library** (lib/) - C-compatible library (libreclaim.so)
  - Enables integration with non-Go applications
  - Provides FFI bindings for core functionality

- **MiniTLS** (minitls/) - Custom TLS 1.2/1.3 implementation
  - Supports split AEAD modifications
  - Implements required cipher suites
  - Enables fine-grained control over TLS operations

- **Providers** (providers/) - HTTP parsing and validation
  - JSON/XML/XPath positioned parsing
  - Response extraction and validation

## Building

### Build All Services

The recommended way to build is using the build script, which builds all services and generates protobuf code:

```bash
./build.sh
```

This will:
1. Generate Go code from protocol buffer definitions
2. Build TEE_K service → `bin/tee_k`
3. Build TEE_T service → `bin/tee_t`
4. Build Client → `bin/client`
5. Build Proxy → `bin/proxy`

### Build Individual Services

You can also build services individually:

```bash
# Build TEE_K
cd tee_k && go build -o ../bin/tee_k . && cd ..

# Build TEE_T
cd tee_t && go build -o ../bin/tee_t . && cd ..

# Build Client
cd demo_standalone && go build -o ../bin/client . && cd ..

# Build Proxy (has separate go.mod)
cd proxy && go mod download && go build -o ../bin/proxy . && cd ..
```

### Build Shared Library

To build the shared library for C/Go interop:

```bash
./lib.sh build
```

This creates `lib/libreclaim.so` that can be used by other applications.

### Generate Protobuf Code

If you modify .proto files, regenerate Go code:

```bash
protoc -I proto --go_out=proto/ --go_opt=paths=source_relative proto/*.proto
```

## Running

### Running the Demo (Recommended)

The easiest way to run the complete system:

```bash
./demo.sh
```

This script will:
1. Build all services using `./build.sh`
2. Start TEE_K service on port 8080 (logs to `/tmp/demo_teek.log`)
3. Start TEE_T service on port 8081 (logs to `/tmp/demo_teet.log`)
4. Run the Client which connects to both services
5. Execute the full TEE + MPC protocol with a test request
6. Display results and shut down gracefully

You can pass additional arguments to configure the demo:
```bash
./demo.sh [client-args]
```

### Running Individual Services

Each service can be run independently for development or testing:

```bash
# Run TEE_K service
./bin/tee_k [port]       # Default: 8080

# Run TEE_T service
./bin/tee_t [port]       # Default: 8081

# Run Client (requires TEE_K and TEE_T to be running)
./bin/client [teek_url]  # Default: ws://localhost:8080/ws

# Run Proxy service
./bin/proxy
```

### Running with the Shared Library

To run the demo using the shared library:

```bash
./lib.sh run
```

Or manually:
```bash
# Build library first
./lib.sh build

# Set library path and run sample app
cd demo_lib
LD_LIBRARY_PATH=../bin:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH ./sample_app_shared
```

## Protocol Overview

This implementation follows the [TEE + MPC protocol](https://reclaimprotocol.notion.site/New-design-research-TEE-MPC-1f1275b816cb80caaa60fcb58a3e780d) for privacy-preserving TLS attestation.

## Development

### Project Organization

- Monorepo structure with single `go.mod` at root (except proxy which has its own)
- Each service is independently buildable
- Shared packages (minitls, shared, providers) used across services
- Protocol definitions centralized in `proto/`

### Code Organization

```
Core Services:     tee_k/, tee_t/, demo_standalone/
Libraries:         minitls/, shared/, providers/, client/
Infrastructure:    proxy/, lib/, proto/
ZK Circuits:       circuits/
Verification:      proofverifier/
```

### Common Development Tasks

```bash
# Regenerate protobufs after .proto changes
protoc -I proto --go_out=proto/ --go_opt=paths=source_relative proto/*.proto

# Build and test
./build.sh && go test ./...

# Run with debug logging
LOG_LEVEL=debug ./demo.sh

# Format and vet code
go fmt ./...
go vet ./...
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Service fails to start:**
- Check if ports 8080/8081 are available
- Verify protobuf files are generated: run `./build.sh`
- Check logs: `/tmp/demo_teek.log` and `/tmp/demo_teet.log`

**TLS connection failures:**
- Ensure target website supports TLS 1.2 or 1.3
- Verify cipher suite compatibility (AES-128-GCM, AES-256-GCM)
- Check certificate validation settings

**WebSocket connection errors:**
- Ensure TEE services are running before starting client
- Check firewall rules and network connectivity
- Verify WebSocket URLs are correct (default: ws://localhost:8080/ws)

**Build failures:**
- Run `go mod download` to fetch dependencies
- Ensure Go 1.25.3+ is installed
- Check for missing protoc compiler installation

**ZK circuit errors:**
- Verify `circuits/` directory contains required proving key and R1CS files
- Check that .pk and .r1cs files exist for configured algorithms
- Ensure sufficient memory for proof generation
